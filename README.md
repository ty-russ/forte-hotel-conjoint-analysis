# CONJOINT ANALYSIS: FORTE HOTEL DESIGN

## Overview
This project focuses on Conjoint Analysis, applied to the design of a new hotel for Forte Hotels.

## Objective
The aim of this project was to determine the most preferred hotel design attributes and their levels using Conjoint Analysis.

## Key Insights
- **Customer Preferences**: The analysis revealed that **luxury amenities** and **central location** were the most influential factors in customer decision-making.
- **Most Preferred Profile**: The ideal hotel design includes a **central city location, a rooftop pool, and a gourmet restaurant**. This combination resulted in the highest total utility among all tested profiles.
- **Market Share Estimation**: Based on the part-worth utilities, the recommended hotel design could capture up to **30% of the market share** in the target demographic.
- **Segmented Analysis**: Two distinct customer segments were identified. **Luxury seekers** prioritize premium amenities, while **budget-conscious travelers** value basic amenities with a central location.

## Methodology
- **Survey Design**: A structured survey was designed to gather data on customer preferences for various hotel attributes.
- **Data Collection**: Respondents were presented with different hotel profiles, each combining multiple attributes at various levels.
- **Conjoint Analysis**: The collected data was analyzed using Conjoint Analysis to estimate the utility values (part-worths) for each attribute level.
