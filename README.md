# CONJOINT ANALYSIS: FORTE HOTEL DESIGN

## Overview
This project focuses on Conjoint Analysis, applied to the design of a new hotel for Forte Hotels.

## Objective
The aim of this project was to determine the most preferred hotel design attributes and their levels using Conjoint Analysis.

## Key Insights
- **Customer Preferences**: The analysis revealed that **luxury amenities** and **central location** were the most influential factors in customer decision-making.
- **Most Preferred Profile**: The ideal hotel design includes a **central city location, a rooftop pool, and a gourmet restaurant**. This combination resulted in the highest total utility among all tested profiles.
- **Market Share Estimation**: Based on the part-worth utilities, the recommended hotel design could capture up to **30% of the market share** in the target demographic.
- **Segmented Analysis**: Two distinct customer segments were identified. **Luxury seekers** prioritize premium amenities, while **budget-conscious travelers** value basic amenities with a central location.

## Project Details
- **Study Design**: Attributes and levels were chosen based on market research.
- **Profiles**: A fractional factorial design was used to create 16 profiles.
- **Results**: 
  - Nissaâ€™s result: Summarized part-worth utility estimates.
  - The most preferred profile: Identified based on total utility.
  - Market Share Estimate: Manual calculation, not based on the conjoint package.
- **Plots**: Segment solutions with relevant interpretations.

## Files in the Repository
